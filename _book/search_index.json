My personal goal is to become more comfortable with the nitty gritty underlying the statistical tools I commonly use - essentially, regression. Edge takes a unique approach in that he takes a small dataset, and dissects regression ‘from scratch’. Each of these bookdown chapters corresponds to each of Edge’s 10 book chapters. The impetus for this bookdown project was the cancellation of my spring 2020 course Experimental Design and Probability due to the coronavirus pandemic. So, I’ll be filling in some gaps in my stats toolkit and learning how to use bookdown. The stfs package can be installed from Github: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;mdedge/stfspack&quot;) library(stfspack) As Edge points out in his Prelude, the typical introductory course in biological statistics (including my own) revolves around learning a series of tests: t-tests, regression, ANOVA . In STFS, the focus instead is on one procedure - simple linear regression - and takes ‘little for granted’ (translation: we’ll be working through the math). The primary dataset consists of 11 observations. The chapters will work through the following: 1. Probability 2. Estimation (use data to guess the values that describe a data generating process) 3. Inference (test hypotheses about the processes that might have generated an observed dataset) How to publish on github: https://community.rstudio.com/t/hosting-bookdown-in-github/20427 "],
["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). "]
