## Probability vs estimation

Here are two quotes from *STFS* that encapsulate the distinction between probability and estimation:

> *In probability theory, we think about processes that generate data, and we ask "what can we say about the data generated by such a process?*

> *In statistical estimation and inference, we work in the opposite direction. We start with data, and we ask "what can we say about the process that generated these data?*

So, we can define probability as the *study of data generated by specified processes* - and that's the focus of this chapter. Later on, when we get to data - we'll be assuming probabilistic models - but we have to accept the fact that the data we observed were not likely to be generated by the assumed model! But we do the best we can. 

## What is a probability?

Frequency view  

  - the probability of a given event is simply the proportion of times it occurs over many trials
  - difficult to apply to statements like "*what is the probability that it will rain tomorrow*" and "*what is the probability that a meteor will hit the earth tomorrow*" (i.e., one-shot events)

Degrees-of-belief view  

  - what is the degree of belief in the occurrence of an event that a rational person would have?

An aside: is the universe fundamentally probabilistic or deterministic?

## Set notation

A **set** ($\Omega$, in *STFS*) is an unordered collection of objects (*elements*). 

**Intersection** ($\cap$) of two sets is the set of elements that appear in both sets. 

**Union** ($\cup$) of two sets is the set that has every element that appears in *either* of the two original sets. 

The **complement** of a set ($S^C$) includes all of the elements *not* in the original set but present in the **sample space** ($\Omega$) (which contains all possible elements). Subsets are referred to as *S*, and have the following properties:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \cup S^C = \Omega  \\
S \cap S^C = \emptyset
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\emptyset$ is used to denote the empty set, or the set with no elements. 

A Venn diagram is useful here:

The notation for the probability of an event is typically denoted using either $P()$ or $[]$: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(event) = [event] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### Kolmogorov's three axioms of probability

1. Probabilities of any event *i* ($E_i$) cannot be negative:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ [E_i] \geq 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

2. The probability of the event that includes every outcome is 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ [\Omega] = 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

3. The probability of observing either of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{If } E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset,  \\
\text{then } [E_1 \cup E_2] = [E_1] + [E_2] 
\end{aligned}
$$

### Exercise set 4-1

1. Given P($A$), we would like to know P($A^C$). We already learned the following properties of complements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A \cup A^C = \Omega  \\
A \cap A^C = \emptyset
\end{aligned}
$$
The intersection between $A$ and $A^C$ is zero, meaning they don't share any elements. The union of $A$ and $A^C$ is $[\Omega]$. We also learned the 2nd axiom of probability, $[\Omega] = 1$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ [A] + [A^C] = 1 \\ 
\ [A^C] = 1 - [A]
\end{aligned}
$$
