## Probability vs estimation

Here are two quotes from *STFS* that encapsulate the distinction between probability and estimation:

> *In probability theory, we think about processes that generate data, and we ask "what can we say about the data generated by such a process?*

> *In statistical estimation and inference, we work in the opposite direction. We start with data, and we ask "what can we say about the process that generated these data?*

So, we can define probability as the *study of data generated by specified processes* - and that's the focus of this chapter. Later on, when we get to data - we'll be assuming probabilistic models - but we have to accept the fact that the data we observed were not likely to be generated by the assumed model! But we do the best we can. 

## What is a probability?

Frequency view  

  - the probability of a given event is simply the proportion of times it occurs over many trials
  - difficult to apply to statements like "*what is the probability that it will rain tomorrow*" and "*what is the probability that a meteor will hit the earth tomorrow*" (i.e., one-shot events)

Degrees-of-belief view  

  - what is the degree of belief in the occurrence of an event that a rational person would have?

An aside: is the universe fundamentally probabilistic or deterministic?

### Set notation

A **set** ($\Omega$, in *STFS*) is an unordered collection of objects (*elements*). 

**Intersection** ($\cap$) of two sets is the set of elements that appear in both sets. 

**Union** ($\cup$) of two sets is the set that has every element that appears in *either* of the two original sets. 

The **complement** of a set ($S^C$) includes all of the elements *not* in the original set but present in the **sample space** ($\Omega$) (which contains all possible elements). Subsets are referred to as *S*, and have the following properties:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \cup S^C = \Omega  \\
S \cap S^C = \emptyset
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\emptyset$ is used to denote the empty set, or the set with no elements. 

A Venn diagram is useful here:

### Kolmogorov's three axioms of probability

1. Probabilities cannot be negative
2. The probability of the event that includes every outcome is 1. 
3. The probability of observing either of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities
